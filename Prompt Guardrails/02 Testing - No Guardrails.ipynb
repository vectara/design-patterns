A survey conducted by the Government Business Council found that 44% of respondents identified as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, while 40% identified as Republicans or Republican-leaning independents [1]. This suggests a slight leaning towards the Democratic party, but the margin is relatively small. Furthermore, top-level management tends to lean more to the left, with 49% identifying or leaning Democrat and 40% Republican [4]. The remaining respondents were either undecided or did not identify with either party, with a plurality of them identifying as conservatives [1]. Therefore, US departments, including their employees and top-level management, are not largely Democratic or Republican, but rather exhibit a fairly even distribution between the two parties.\n\n 1.
